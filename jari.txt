What people don't get about Endor is that, in order for it to be so heavily forested, there must be sources of water. [13:08] ￼ Well, there are - large underground aquifers that not only provide sufficient water for the plant growth, but also are the home to large and varied species of fish. [13:09] ￼ However, Endorian flora have some unique properties. The root systems that extend throughout the aquifers take in water not through osmosis, but through a complex series of chemical exchanges that absorb H2O into the plant. One of the byproducts of this chemical exchange is a certain plant-made opiate that is released into the aquifer. [13:09] ￼ Over the millenia, the gradually rising level of opiates in the water would certainly have killed all of the aquatic life, if not for an ingenious evolutionary trait they developed that shunts the opiates into a separate digestive tract, collecting them harmlessly in special pockets that they keep as far away from the brain as possible - namely, in the fins and the tail. The fish can then forcefully release the collected opiates through an opening in the tail, providing them a burst of speed when confronted with predators. [13:09] ￼ Of course, as a result, you can never be sure if a fish you catch on Endor will have any opiates in the tail - it depends on how much running it's done lately. But it's widely known that the greatest high in the galaxy can be achieved through the consumption of Endor fins. <@U0J5L8D6E>: \"Endor fins\" :awesome:
